# Clipboard & OCR Manager Dependencies
# Streamlined requirements for unified clipboard and OCR functionality

# CORE DEPENDENCIES - Required for basic functionality
# ================================================

# GUI and Image Processing
Pillow>=9.0.0               # Image handling, screenshots, screen capture
requests>=2.25.0            # HTTP requests for LLM APIs (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini)

# Text Capture System  
pyperclip>=1.8.0            # Cross-platform clipboard access
keyboard>=1.13.0            # Global hotkey monitoring for Ctrl+C detection

# Note: No traditional OCR libraries needed - we use LLM vision APIs for OCR
# This provides better accuracy and handles complex layouts/fonts

# DEVELOPMENT DEPENDENCIES (uncomment for development)
# ==================================================
# pytest>=7.4.0            # Testing framework  
# black>=23.0.0             # Code formatting
# flake8>=6.0.0             # Code linting

# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
# ========================

# 1. Install Python dependencies:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Install system-level OCR engine:
#    Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng
#    Windows: Download from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
#    macOS: brew install tesseract

# 3. Set up API keys (for AI features):
#    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_claude_key"     # For Claude
#    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"        # For ChatGPT/GPT-4
#    export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_key"        # For Gemini

# FEATURE BREAKDOWN BY DEPENDENCY
# ===============================
# Pillow: Image display, screenshots, canvas preview
# requests: LLM API calls (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini)
# pyperclip: Clipboard text access
# keyboard: Ctrl+C detection and hotkeys
# pytesseract: Traditional OCR text extraction
# opencv-python: Image preprocessing, better OCR accuracy
# numpy: Mathematical operations for image processing
# easyocr: Alternative AI-powered OCR engine

# NOTES
# =====
# - tkinter: Included with Python standard library (GUI framework)
# - Some features gracefully degrade if optional dependencies are missing
# - Linux users may need elevated permissions for keyboard monitoring
# - Windows users may need to install Visual C++ Redistributable for OpenCV

# MINIMUM INSTALLATION (core features only)
# ========================================
# pip install Pillow>=10.0.0 pyperclip>=1.8.2 keyboard>=0.13.5 requests>=2.28.0
